# SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension

This project is new and under active development. A Nuget package will be released soon.

SpawnDev.BlazorJS.BrowserExtension adds the ability for Blazor WASM to run as a web browser extension. Blazor can run in all extension contexts. Runs in content context (in page with any site), popup window, options window, and the background.
